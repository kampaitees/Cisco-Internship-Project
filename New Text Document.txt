Hi, this is rishi Sharma, I and my other team member will be presenting the work which we have done on our Autonomous mini ground 
bot Kinect based as a part, of course, AM477 open-source virtual instrumentation.

So these are the things which we will discuss in the presentation
Motivation, objective, a bit about the project what things used hardware, software, then  the final proposed system which we have used 
after seeing the various system available in the literature, then the results which we obtained after applying the algorithm, and future
 work so that the project can be extended to next level

So the main motivation behind the project is that this type of autonomous bot can significantly reduce the human work they can do all the
 laborious low-value work which is bit tedious and takes time when done by a human so that human can do the task which can't be automated
 and requires more intelligence. These bots can also help the humans by using them in the hazardous area where there may be a risk to 
life for example in war or security places, these bots can also increase the productivity and efficiency 

the objective of the project is to design a low-cost autonomous robot, using effective motion planning  algorithm as well as ensuring
 human safety and making the obstacle detection  rate as high as possible 

here is a bit Introduction about the project these autonomous robots are highly used and has many applications  and as discussed before 
can be used in security purposes, serving humans, executing a job routine, household maintenances, delivering goods and services
In this project, autonomous navigation of the bot is presented. Like any other bot, the design of bot is divided into two parts hardware
 and software. The sensor used in the project is the Kinect sensor whereas the hardware bot is a Turtlebot 2. For the software part we 
used ROS.

This is what the turtle bot looks like

Now we will discuss the hardware and software part which we= have used in our project

Proposed system
so we have first specified the starting and destination to the turtle bot if it detects the obstacles in the path it will turn left 
or right based on the coordinate of the obstacle then after avoiding the obstacle it will find the next path from there to the 
destination and start moving on that path till it will find the obstacle again and will repeat the process again and again till it 
reaches the destination
